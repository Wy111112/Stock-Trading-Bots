# Datasets for TDH-DQN trading bot By Gregory Roy 
Multi-Timeframe Algorithmic Trading Bots using Thick Data Heuristics with Deep Reinforcement Learning<br>
This article presents an augmented Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithmic trading approach that combines Thick Data Heuristic (TDH), with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to successfully learn trading execution timing policies. Combining the augmented AI human trader's intuition and heuristics with DRL techniques to provide more focused drivers for trading order execution timing is explored in this study. In this research, the goal is to solve the sequential decision-making problem of AI for profitable day and swing trading order timing executions. Enabling trading bots with cognitive intelligence and common-sense heuristics will offer traders including automatic traders an insight to understand the day-to-day swing trading timeframes indicators and arrive at mature trading decision-making. This article examines the performance of bots with Nasdaq and NYSE stocks that have a strong catalyst (info. which increases directional momentum) to find that they outperform benchmark algorithmic trading approaches. The research illustrates to the reader how to combine TDH and Deep Q-networks (DQN) into a TDH-DQN augmented AI trading bot. The bot learns through test data to predict the optimal timing of order executions autonomously on idealized trading time series data.<br>

SUMMARY: In the author's master's thesis titled, 'Multi-Timeframe Algorithmic Trading Bots using Thick
Data Heuristics with Deep Reinforcement Learning' he studied all the modern Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms. When the movies and media refer to "AI", they are referring to the field of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) studied rigorously by computer scientists.<br>

BACKGROUND: DRL agents can do amazing things, including playing Atari, chess, and Go. And yet they
are all versions of a Turing Machine, which is an abstract model that sets the limits of what can be done by a
computer through its mathematical logic. The author would argue no conscious, intelligent entity is going to
emerge from a Turing Machine. This is the reason the author has taken an augmented AI approach. Currently,
augmented AI is the best form of AI we have available as stock traders. The bots can deal with more tasks
better than human traders do, including predicting stock buying and selling order timing executions [9].

METHODS: In the thesis, combining the augmented AI human trader's intuition and heuristics with DRL
techniques to provide more focused drivers for trading order execution timing was explored. The thesis
illustrates to the reader how to combine Thick Data Heuristics (TDH) and Deep Q-networks (DQN) into a
TDH-DQN augmented AI trading bot. The bot learns through test data to predict the optimal timing of order
executions autonomously on idealized trading time series data.
PROBLEM DEFINITION: Solve the sequential decision-making problem formalized of trading as an MDP
optimization of order timing executions for a single catalyst stock. The environment for the experiments was
comprised of the observation space including the state, discrete action space (discrete for the bot, but
continuous for human (buy, sell, wait)), and finally rewards.
<br>
RESULTS: DRL and ML algorithms cannot entirely replace human intuition and heuristics. Complex models,
if not correctly guided can over-fit or uncover false relationships and patterns. Crafting financial models is an
art form more than a science. It's important to test many different model parameters and train the model for the
appropriate market conditions. The author would argue that to be successful at algorithmic trading it is not
about finding the holy grail cocktail of trading rules, sentiment, or fundamental or technical analysis that will
always be correct. It is about crafting specific models using experience and intuition to catalyst stocks at
specific times.
<br>
CONCLUSIONS: The application of DRL still requires significant human intervention and domain expertise.
Humans must still be relied upon to define objectives, select, and curate data, design and optimize a model,
and make appropriate use of the results. The use of powerful models with a high capacity to learn patterns
requires particular care to avoid over-fitting when the signal-to-noise ratio is as low as is often the case with
financial data. Furthermore, the competitive nature of trading implies that patterns evolve quickly as signals
decay, requiring additional attention to performance monitoring and model maintenance.
